# Listing and Manipulating Processes
## About ps options
Confusingly, you can specify options in three different ways -- Unix, BSD, and GNU.  
Most people use BSD style.
- `ps x` Show all of your running processes.
- `ps ax` Show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own.
- `ps u` Include more detailed information on processes.
- `ps w` Show full command names, not just what fits on one line.


Note that you can combine options like `ps aux`.


## Killing Processes
To terminate a process, send it a signal with the kill command. A signal is a
message to a process from the kernel.
There are [plenty of signals][kill_signals].
The default signal is `TERM` (terminate).
Instead of killing the process, you can freeze it with:  
`$ kill -STOP pid`
and continue with:  
`$ kill -CONT pid`

The most brutal way to terminate a process is with the `KILL` signal.
Other signals give the process a chance to clean up after itself, but `KILL`
does not.

Using ctrl-C to terminate a process that is running in the current terminal is the
same as using kill to end the process with the `INT` (interrupt) signal.

# File Operations
## Symbolic Links
A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or directory.

`$ ln -s target linkname`
- `-s` specifies a symbolic link

Without `-s`, ln creates a hard link, which points directly to the file date instead of another filename as asymbolic link does.
This can be quite confusing if you do not have enough knowledge.

## tar
### compression
To create an archive, you can use `tar`

`$ tar cvf archive.tar file1 file2 ...`
- `c` denotes create mode
- `v` denotes verbose mode
- `f` denotes file option ( the following argument must be the archive file for tar to create)

### unpacking
`$ tar xvf archive.tar`  

- `x` denotes extract mode
By using `t` flag instead of `x`, you can verify the archive\`s basic integrity and print the names of all files inside.
Adding `p` option preserve original permissions instead of automatically applying `umask` to extracted files.
