# Compare a file across different branches
This shows a diff
```bash
git diff <branch1>:<path/to/file> <branch2>:<path/to/file>
```

You can even apply the changes based on this diff
```bash
git diff <branch1>:<path/to/file> <branch2>:<path/to/file> | git apply
```

# `git rm --cached`
This won't remove a file from your local machine.
Also, this is **recorded differently from `git rm`** by git.
Let's say I run `git rm --cached garbage-file`, commit and push it.
When another person pulls this commit, the `garbage-file` on his local machine will not be deleted.
It's simply untracked.
