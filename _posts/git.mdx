# Compare a file across different branches
This shows a diff
```bash
git diff <branch1>:<path/to/file> <branch2>:<path/to/file>
```

You can even apply the changes based on this diff
```bash
git diff <branch1>:<path/to/file> <branch2>:<path/to/file> | git apply
```

# `git rm --cached`
This won't remove a file from your local machine.
Also, this is **recorded differently from `git rm`** by git.
Let's say I run `git rm --cached garbage-file`, commit and push it.
When another person pulls this commit, the `garbage-file` on his local machine will not be deleted.
It simply becomes untracked.

# Deleting submodule completely
https://gist.github.com/myusuf3/7f645819ded92bda6677
```bash
# Remove the submodule entry from .git/config
git submodule deinit -f path/to/submodule

# Remove the submodule directory from the superproject's .git/modules directory
rm -rf .git/modules/path/to/submodule

# Remove the entry in .gitmodules and remove the submodule directory located at path/to/submodule
git rm -f path/to/submodule
```
