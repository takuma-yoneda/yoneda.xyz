# Build from a local docker image
https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/issues/1537#issuecomment-557527638
```
singularity build <image_name.sif> docker-daemon://<docker_image>:<tag>
```

Another option is to transcribe Dockerfile to definition file:
```bash
# You need to pip install spython first
$ spython recipe Dockerfile &> Singularity.def
```
But I found it not to work properly.

# Run command
What I frequently use:
- `--nv`: allow access to gpus
- `-C` or `--containall`: isolate filesystem, PID, IPC, and environment variables from host
- `-B <src>:<dest>` or `--bind <src>:<dest>`: same as `-v` (mount) in docker. src is the path on the host, dest is the path in the container
- `--pwd <path>`: specify working directory (NOTE: confusingly, `--workdir` is for something different)
- `--fakeroot`: run container in new user namespace as uid 0
```bash
singularity run --fakeroot --nv --containall -B <source-path>:<target-path> --pwd <default_dir> <sif_file> bash -c '<cmd>'
```

# Persistent Overlays
When I use mujoco_py (I still use MuJoCo v2.0), it attempts to create a lock file at `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/mujoco_py/generated/mujocopy-buildlock`, and fails with:
```bash
>>> import mujoco_py
...
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: b'/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/mujoco_py/generated/mujocopy-buildlock'
```
Previously I avoided this with [Persistent Overlays](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/persistent_overlays.html).
Recently I've learned that by simply adding `--writable-tmpfs` at runtime is enough.
I can just do `singularity run --writable-tmpfs d4rl.sif bash` and mujoco_py works fine.

:::details --fakeroot flag
If you see the same error, you should double check the ownership of the directory.
On Ubuntu 20.04 with apptainer version 1.1.0, I still got the same exact error.
When I checked the ownership:
```bash
$ singularity run --nv --containall --writable-tmpfs robosuite.sif bash
Apptainer> ls -lah /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/mujoco_py/generated/mujocopy-buildlock
-rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 0 Aug 15 20:49 /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/mujoco_py/generated/mujocopy-buildlock
Apptainer> id
uid=1002(ripl) gid=1002(ripl) groups=1002(ripl),65534(nogroup)
Apptainer> whoami
ripl
Apptainer> groups
ripl nogroup
Apptainer> id nobody
uid=65534(nobody) gid=65534(nogroup) groups=65534(nogroup)
```
This is so weird... But I could get it resolved with `--fakeroot` flag.

Hmmm this time using `--writable-tmpfs` didn't solve it:
```bash
>>> import mujoco_py
...
OSError: [Errno 95] Operation not supported: b'/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/mujoco_py/generated/mujocopy-buildlock'
```
It seems like the issue of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace). [A website by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/kb/dbfs/errno95-operation-not-supported) says:

> Direct appends and random writes are not supported in FUSE v2
In this case, I needed to use [Persistent Overlay](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/persistent_overlays.html).
```bash
$ mkdir -p overlay/upper
$ mkdir overlay/work
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=overlay.img bs=1M count=500 && mkfs.ext3 -d overlay overlay.img
$ singularity shell --overlay overlay.img ubuntu.sif
```

{/* # Basics */}
{/* - `singularity help [command]` shows help for the command */}
{/* - You need to be root to build from a recipe */}
{/*   - `sudo singularity build --sandbox lolcow Singularity.def` */}
{/* - Container file formats */}
{/*   - `squashfs`: default. immutable (cannot edit, typically `.simg / .sif` extension) */}
{/*   - `sandbox`: you can tinker with it (it is a simple directory that contains everything) */}
  
{/* - `singularity shell --writable lolcow`: writable option allows us to write in the container. And that will persist. */}
