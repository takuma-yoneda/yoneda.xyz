## Abstract
- Achieves 150+ FPS to render 800x800 images (3000x faster than NeRFs)
- It pre-tabulates the NeRF into a PlenocTree
- It removes viewing direction as an input to the neural network, and predicts a spherical harmonic representation of radiandce (??)

## Terms
- Lambertian (= diffuse?) vs non Lambertian
- Neural Volumes

**What's wrong with NeRF?**
> NeRF rendering is slow since it requires dense sampling of the scene, where every sample requires a neural network inference
They overcome ths by pre-sampling the NeRF into a tabulated view-dependent volume (PlenOctree)

what the heck is that?

**Spherical Harmonics (SH)**
A standard basis for functions defined on the surface of the sphere. This enables to recover the view-dependent color

How to integrate SH:
- They train a network that produces coefficients for the SH functions instead of raw RGB values
  - The predicted coefficients are stored in PlenOctree
- They also introduce a sparsity prior during NeRF training to improve the memory efficiency


How they train NeRF faster:
Stop the training of NeRf early and convert it into a PleOctree. Then it can be trained much faster as there's no neural nets.

## Method
NeRF-SH: a variant of the NeRF that directly outputs the SH coefficients (no input for view-direction)

Converting NeRF representation to PlenOctree is straightforward: simply evaluate it on a uniform grid.
