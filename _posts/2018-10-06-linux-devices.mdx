This chapter describes the way to extract information about the devices and understand a few rudimentary operations.
# Device files
When you list files in `/dev`,
```bash
$ ls -l /dev
crw-rw-rw-   1 root   tty       5,     2 Oct  6 19:28 ptmx
drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root             0 Oct  6 18:07 pts
crw-rw-rw-   1 root   root      1,     8 Oct  6 18:07 random
crw-rw-r--+  1 root   netdev   10,    62 Oct  6 18:07 rfkill
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root             4 Oct  6 18:07 rtc -> rtc0
crw-------   1 root   root    249,     0 Oct  6 18:07 rtc0
brw-rw----   1 root   disk      8,     0 Oct  6 18:07 sda
brw-rw----   1 root   disk      8,     1 Oct  6 18:07 sda1
brw-rw----   1 root   disk      8,     2 Oct  6 18:07 sda2
brw-rw----   1 root   disk      8,     3 Oct  6 18:07 sda3
...
```
You can find device files.
These device files are sometimes called "device nodes".

The first characther in each row represents a type of a device:
- b: block device
- c: character device
- p: pipe device
- s: socket device

One or two numbers before the date are the *major* and *minor* device numbers that help the kernel identify the device.

## Block device
Block devices typically refer to disk devices. Since the **total size of the devices are fixed**, they are easily indexed and processes can randomly access to any block.

## Character device
Character devices work with *data streams*.  
You can only read characters from or write characters to character devices.  
**Character devices do not have a size.**

## Pipe device
skip

## Socket device
Sockets are special-purpose interfaces that are frequently used for *interprocess communication*.

### Remark
Not all devices have device files because the block and character device I/O interfaces are not appropriate in all cases (e.g., network devices)

## The issues of /dev device files?
`/dev` directory is a convenient way for user processes to handle devices, however, there are several issues for kernel:
- Simple names do not tell much about the info of device
- Device names are assigned in the order in which they are found (one physical device can get different name on reboot)

To overcome these, Linux kernel offers the *sysfs interface* through files and directories (/sys/devices).
For example, a hard disk at `/dev/sda` might have the following path in sysfs:
```
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda
```
Note that these two paths have different purposes. The `/dev` file is for user processes to *use the device*, whereas the `/sys/devices` path is for *viewing information and manage the device***.


# Device Name summary
## Hard disks: /dev/sd\*
The kernel makes separate device files for the partitions on a disk.

## Terminals: /dev/tty\*, /dev/pts/\*, and /dev/tty
Terminals are devices for moving characters between a user process and
an I/O device, usually for text output to a terminal screen.

### Column: Display Modes and VIrtual Consoles
Linux has two display modes: *text-mode* and *X Window System server (graphics mode)*.  
Linux supports *virtual consoles* to multiplex the display. Each virtual console can run either in text or graphics mode.
When you are in text-mode, you can switch between virtual consoles by pressing `ALT-F*` (function key like F1, F2).
When you are in X11 session, you can do that by `CTRL-ALT-F*`.
