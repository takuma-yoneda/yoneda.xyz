# Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials
- `/bin` Contains ready-to-run programs (also known as an executables), including most of the basic Unix
commands such as ls and cp.
- `/dev` Contains device files. Explained later probably...
- `/etc` This core system configuration directory (pronounced EHT-see) contains the user password, boot,
device, networking, and other setup files. Many items in /etc are specific to the machine’s hardware. For
example, the /etc/X11 directory contains graphics card and window system configurations.
- `/home` Holds personal directories for regular users.
- `/lib` An abbreviation for library, this directory holds library files containing code that executables can use.
There are two types of libraries: static and shared. The /lib directory should contain only shared libraries (cf. /usr/share)
- `/proc` Provides system statistics through a browsable directory-and-file interface. The /proc
directory contains information about currently running processes as well as some kernel parameters.
- `/sys` This directory is similar to /proc in that it provides a device and system interface. 
- `/sbin` The place for system executables. Programs in /sbin directories relate to system management, so
regular users usually do not have /sbin components in their command paths.
- `/tmp` skip
- `/usr` Although pronounced “user,” this subdirectory has no user files. Instead, it contains a large directory
hierarchy, including the bulk of the Linux system. 
- `/var` The variable subdirectory, where programs record runtime information. System logging, user tracking,
caches, and other files that system programs create and manage are here.

## About /usr directory
`/usr` is where most of the user-space programs and data reside. In addition to `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, and `/usr/lib`, `/usr` contains the following:
- `/include` Holds header files used by the C compiler.
- `/info` Contains GNU info manuals
- `/local` Is where administrators can install their own software. Its structure should look like that of / and /usr.
- `/man` Contains manual pages.
- `/share` Contains files that should work on other kinds of Unix machines with no loss of functionality.
