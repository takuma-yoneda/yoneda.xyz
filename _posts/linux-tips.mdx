## Mounting a remote NFS directory
- [Arch Wiki -- NFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NFS)
- [How to Mount an NFS Share in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-an-nfs-share-in-linux/)
First the client machine needs NFS client package
```
# Arch
pacman -S nfs-utils
# Ubuntu
apt install nfs-common
```

**Get to know what IP addresses are allowed to use the NFS**
On the NFS client:
```
$ showmount -e birch.ttic.edu
Export list for birch.ttic.edu:
/ripl xxx.xxx.xxx.176/28
```

<Collapse title="On the NFS server side">
On the NFS server (birch.ttic.edu):
```
$ sudo exportfs -v
/ripl         	xxx.xxx.xxx.176/28(rw,wdelay,crossmnt,root_squash,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,rw,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash)
```
You can also see the same info in `/etc/exports`.
</Collapse>


`/28` is the subnet mask that corresponds to `255.255.255.240`.
(This value is the number of 1s counted from the left; [subnet mask cheat sheet](https://dnsmadeeasy.com/support/subnet))
This means there are 15 IP addresses (176 to 191) allowed to access the NFS.

<Collapse title="If the NFS client is not in the allowed IP list">
Edit `/etc/exports` on the server side.
Assuming the new client has IP address `xxx.xxx.xxx.28`,
```
/ripl xxx.xxx.xxx.176/28(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,crossmnt,fsid=0)
/ripl xxx.xxx.xxx.28(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,crossmnt,fsid=0)
```
Note that `fsid=0` is added to the option list. [About fsid](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/427597/implications-of-using-nfsv4-fsid-0-and-exporting-the-nfs-root-to-entire-lan-or)
then reload the NFS export configuration
```
$ sudo exportfs -r
```
</Collapse>

You can edit `/etc/fstab` in the NFS client machine by adding:
```
birch.ttic.edu:/ripl/data /ripl/data nfs defaults 0 0
birch.ttic.edu:/ripl/user /ripl/user nfs defaults 0 0
```

Then don't forget to reload the mount
```
sudo mount -a
```

## Annoying issues

### sudo rejects my correct password!!
```
# Check if systemd-homed is running
systemctl status systemd-homed
# If not, start it
su root  # Log in as root
systemctl start systemd-homed
```

In some other occasions, (re?)installing `pambase` fixes this.
```
pacman -S pambase
```
