MDX is a superset of markdown! (i.e., you can put JSX inside markdown)
It's nice to include dynamic contents in a markdown.

Okay, converting markdown involves several steps
1. Convert markdown to an AST (abstract syntax tree)
2. Convert AST to html

There're several libraries that does conversion
- markdown-it (This is what `zenn-markdown-html` is based on, which is what I use now; This has been defacto-standard)
- remark (This seems to be a new option; Documentation is much better here)

I found an [article](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy/discussions/16#discussioncomment-905378) that compares these two.
In remark, `remark` does the step 1 and `rehype` does the step 2


The block container thing (message and warning) was done via [markdown-it-container](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-container) under the hood.
